# My Fantasy Life
It's a MMORPG *(Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)* developed by [Madylune](https://github.com/Madylune). I was inspired by the heroic fantasy universe and the Asian culture.
At the beginning, I wanted to democratize online dating with a video game. It's a more playful way to create relationships.

This game is developed with [Unity](https://unity.com/fr).
